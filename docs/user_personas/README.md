# User personas directory

Welcome to the `user_personas` directory. This directory stores user personas essential for the project.

## Purpose

This directory provides a centralized location for user personas. These personas represent different types of users who interact with the project and help software developers gain a deeper understanding of the users' goals, needs, and pain points. By having a clear understanding of the users, developers can create more user-centric features and improve the user experience.

## Contents

This directory stores each persona in a separate file. Name files after the personas they describe, for example, `persona_jane_doe.md`. Each persona file includes the following sections:

- **Name**: The name of the persona.
- **Demographics**: Key demographic information such as age, gender, occupation, etc.
- **Goals**: The primary goals and motivations of the persona.
- **Needs**: Specific needs and requirements of the persona.
- **Pain Points**: Challenges and issues the persona faces.
- **Behavior**: Typical behaviors and habits of the persona.
- **Scenarios**: Example scenarios that illustrate how the persona interacts with the project.

## Usage

Software developers and other project stakeholders refer to these personas throughout the development process. Common uses of the personas include:

- **Feature Design**: Aligning feature design with the personas' goals and needs.
- **User Testing**: Creating test scenarios based on the personas' behaviors and pain points.
- **Prioritization**: Prioritizing development tasks that address the most critical needs and challenges of the personas.

By incorporating user personas into the workflow, the project better resonates with users and delivers exceptional value.
